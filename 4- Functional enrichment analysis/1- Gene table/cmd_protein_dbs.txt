# To speed annotation, split B. brachyistius protein file. We used Maker's fasta_tool:
fasta_tool --chunks 10   000_Bbrach_ref/ncbi_dataset/data/GCF_023856365.1/protein.faa 


# make blast database. Notice that the protein file used here is from Danio rerio.

module load GCC/10.2.0  OpenMPI/4.0.5
module load BLAST+/2.11.0

makeblastdb -in protein.faa -dbtype prot -parse_seqids


# run blastp with sb_07_blastp.sh


# merge the blastp results
cat ./split_blast_results/*blastp > merged_blast_results_ncbi.blastp


# when using my_gene I realized that two Bbrach proteins were blasted to a depracated Drerio protein. I went back to this blast folder and reblasted these 2 proteins and chose the second best match. Then I updated the merged_blast_results_ncbi.blastp file (the final file is called merged_blast_results_ncbi.blastp_fixed)
