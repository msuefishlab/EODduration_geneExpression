To create this file, we first identified homologous proteins predicted from the B. brachyistius reference genome and those predicted
from Danio rerio (GRCz11) by blastp (BLAST+v2.11.0, Camacho et al., 2009). For each protein,
the top hit (e-value â‰¤1e-10) was used for annotation. 

Then, we used mygene v1.32.0 (Wu et al., 2013; Xin et al., 2016) to match the D. rerio proteins to D. rerio genes.
