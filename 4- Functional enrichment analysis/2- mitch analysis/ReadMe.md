The R code in the file contrasts_mitch.R accomplishes the following:  

1) Run the mitch analysis
2) Identify the gene sets of interest
3) Find the genes common to these gene sets and the differentially expressed genes from edgeR

Items 1 and 2 complete the Functional enrichment analysis. Item 3 is the first procedure to find the "differentially expressed genes of highest interest for EOD duration" (the second procedure is done manually, as explained in the manuscript).
